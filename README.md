# üß∞ Slimefun Networks Visualizer üß∞

Slimefun Network Visualizer aims to make creating, managing, and debugging constructed networks from the [Networks addon](https://github.com/Sefiraat/Networks) easier by providing textures to key Networks blocks, such as Network Bridges, to give key information to players as to what each block does / is doing purely by visuals.

# Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

__THIS WILL APPLY THE TEXTURES TO VANILLA GLASS & GLAZED TERRACOTTA AS WELL__

__THIS IS MEANT TO BE USED SOLELY WHEN BUILDING OR DEBUGGING A NETWORK__

Please do not complain when you see your regular glass and glazed terracotta retextured, as I will promptly admit you to your nearest Optometrist if you do.

# :hammer_and_wrench: Usage 

Vanilla / Forge: Install [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads)

Fabric: Install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity/versions) and [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn/versions)

Download the latest resourcepack from [here](https://github.com/54M44R/Slimefun-Networks-Visualizer/releases), and drop it into your resourcepack folder. Proceed to toggle on / off when building or debugging your network.

# Screenshots üì∑

Feel free to preview the look of the textured blocks and GUI here. Elements such as bridges will connect with one another texture wise. The cardinal directions visible in the GUI will change depending whether or not they've been selected.
