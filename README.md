# üß∞ Slimefun Networks Visualizer üß∞

Slimefun Network Visualizer aims to make creating, managing, and debugging constructed networks from the [Networks addon](https://github.com/Sefiraat/Networks) easier by providing textures to key Networks blocks, such as Network Bridges, to give key information to players as to what each block does / is doing purely by visuals.

# Notice ‚ö†Ô∏è

__THIS WILL APPLY THE TEXTURES TO VANILLA GLASS AS WELL__

__THIS IS MEANT TO BE USED SOLELY WHEN BUILDING OR DEBUGGING A NETWORK__

Please do not complain when you see your regular stained glass retextured, as I will promptly admit you to your nearest Optometrist if you do.

# :hammer_and_wrench: Usage
